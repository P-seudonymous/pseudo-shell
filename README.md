## pseudo-shell

making a basic shell to better understand how the existing shells work.

### stuff to do

- [x] basic input/output
- [ ] tokenization, to process the input given by the user
- [ ] executing syscalls, like `fork()` and `exec()`
- [ ] adding inbuilt commands, like `cd`, `ls -l`, `pwd`.
